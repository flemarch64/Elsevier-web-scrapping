# Elsevier-web-scrapping
This project consists in making some web scrapping using Elsevier APIs

A data frame is obtained with the result of a search in the Science Direct website: https://www.sciencedirect.com/

First, you need to get an API key to be able to use the elsevier API in this website: https://dev.elsevier.com/

Once you run search_scidir.py, you will get a data frame called "df1" which contains all the publications results linked to your search.
